Developed a console-based application for efficiently managing restaurant orders, leveraging core Java concepts and data structures. The system includes the following key components:
Restaurant Class: Manages order queues using an ArrayDeque, ensuring efficient order handling and processing.
Main Class: Facilitates user interactions, processes orders, and handles file operations to maintain order records.

Key Responsibilities:
Designed and implemented the overall system architecture, focusing on scalability and performance.
Utilized ArrayDeque for optimal order queue management, ensuring quick addition and removal of orders.
Developed robust user interaction modules to simulate real-world restaurant order management scenarios.
Implemented file operations for persistent storage of order data, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure the application operates smoothly under various conditions.

Technologies Used:
Java
Data Structures (ArrayDeque)
File I/O Operations

Outcome:
Successfully created a functional and efficient console-based Restaurant Management System that improved the process of managing and processing restaurant orders, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and proficiency in Java programming.
